## What is pynipper-ng?
pynipper-ng is a **configuration security analyzer for network devices**. The goal of this tool is check the vulnerabilities and misconfigurations of routers, firewalls and switches reporting the issues in a simple way.

This tool is based on [nipper-ng](https://github.com/arpitn30/nipper-ng), updated and translated to Python. The project wants to improve the set of rules that detect security misconfigurations of the network devices due to the new architecture (using Python pynipper modules) and integrate with APIs (like [PSIRT Cisco API](https://developer.cisco.com/docs/psirt/#!overview/overview)) to scan known vulnerabilities. 

## Install

The requirements are:

* Python 3.7.x or latest
* PIP

### PIP install

You can install pynipper-ng with PIP using the wheel package linked in each version of the tool.

```BASH
pip install pynipper_ng-<VERSION>-py3-none-any.whl
```

It will be in `pypi` registry soon.

### Source code install

```BASH
python setup.py build install
```

## Quickstart and options

### Quickly demo

```BASH
pynipper-ng -d IOS_ROUTER -i tests\test_data\cisco_ios_example.conf -o HTML -f ./report.html -x
```

## More information

### Pynipper-ng Configuration File

The configuration file is used to define some properties and customize the scans.

#### Pynipper-ng Configuration File: PSIRT Cisco API

To use the PSIRT Cisco API you must provide the API keys. To get it: [https://apiconsole.cisco.com/](https://apiconsole.cisco.com/)

```conf
[Cisco]
CLIENT_ID = <your-client-id>
CLIENT_SECRET = <your-client-secret-token>
```

### Contributing

Contribution are welcome! Please follow the steps defined in CONTRIBUTING file and share your improvements with the community.

### CISCO IOS API integration

Get your credentials and put into the configuration file.

### Pynipper modules

Pynipper-ng detects device configuration weaknesses based on modules. Pynipper modules checks into the network device configuration with regex if a property is set or not, and report it when this is not secure.

#### Pynipper modules summary

Cisco IOS Modules: [check here](src/analyze/cisco/cisco_ios_process/modules/README.md)

#### Implements your modules

You can also implements your modules. Pynipper-ng has not a option to incorporate it by CLI or similar, but contributions are welcome! With a contribution, you can help a lot of users with the same problem and you can improve the community :).

To create your own modules, follow [this guidelines](src/analyze/README.md)
