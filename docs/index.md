# Welcome to pynipper-ng documentation!

**pynipper-ng** is a configuration security analyzer for network devices. The goal of this tool is **check the vulnerabilities and misconfigurations** of routers, firewalls and switches reporting the issues in a simple way.

## Why pynipper-ng?

This tool is based on [nipper-ng](https://github.com/arpitn30/nipper-ng), updated and translated to Python. The project wants to improve the set of rules that detect security misconfigurations of the network devices using multiple standard benchmarks (like CIS Benchmark) and integrate the tool with APIs (like PSIRT Cisco API) to scan known vulnerabilities.

## Current status

**pynipper-ng** currently is in an ALPHA version, because it is under construction.
